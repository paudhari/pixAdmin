<h3 style="text-align: center;">How to use the Customer View?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Customer view option allows you to share the eZowebo product range with your customer without sharing your price, schemes and promotion details. In the "Customer View"  mode your customer would be able to see all products, their information and images with only the prescribed MRP. His choice of product can also be added to your cart. To complete the purchase transaction you will need to switch out of the "Customer View"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure the confidentiality of your price and margins we have made this option pass pin protected and you will need to use the last four digits of your registered mobile number (RMN) to use this feature. You can at any time reset this pass code using the "Reset Pin" button. This will send a pin  your registered mobile number (RMN). You will need to use the same pin to switch back from the customer view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This feature allows you to show case products to your customer that you do not have at your shop and allows you to pre-book and buy these against a confirmed customer order. Happy selling!</p>
